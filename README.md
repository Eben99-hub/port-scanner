# 🔍 Simple Python Port Scanner

This is a beginner-friendly cybersecurity project that scans for open ports on a target host.

## 🚀 How It Works
- Uses Python's built-in `socket` library.
- Attempts to connect to each port (1–1024).
- Prints out which ports are open.

## 🧰 Usage
```bash
python port_scanner.py
